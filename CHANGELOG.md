# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased
### Added
 - PNDA-2729: Added support for spark streaming jobs written in python (pyspark). Use `main_py` instead of `main_jar` in properties.json and specify additional files using `py_files`.
### Changed
 - PNDA-2700: Spark streaming jobs no longer require upstart.conf or yarn-kill.py files, default ones are supplied by the deployment manager.


## [0.3.0] 2017-01-20
### Fixed
- PNDA-2498: Application package data is now stored in HDFS with a reference to the path only held in the HBase record. This prevents HBase being overloaded with large packages (100MB+).

### Changed
- PNDA-2485: Pinned all python libraries to strict version numbers
- PNDA-2499: Return all exceptions to API caller

## [0.2.1] 2016-12-12
### Changed
- Externalized build logic from Jenkins to shell script so it can be reused
- Refactored the information returned by the Application Detail API to include the YARN application state and also to return information for jobs that have ended. Made the implementation more performant by using the YARN Resource Manager REST API instead of the CLI.

## [0.2.0] 2016-10-21
### Added
- PNDA-2233 Jupyter notebook plugin added to deployment manager

## [0.1.1] 2016-09-13
### Changed
- Improvements to documentation

## [0.1.0] 2016-07-01
### First version

- Improve package validation to catch packages without 3 point version numbers and where the folder inside the tar does not match the package name.
- Add list of zookeeper nodes to quorum
- Remove port=8020 for named service
